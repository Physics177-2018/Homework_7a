    "This problem is motivated by Chapter 7 of *Computational Physics, Second Edition* by N. Giordano and H. Nakanishi. \n",
    "\n",
    "The drunkard's walk is an example of a **stochastic** system---that's just a fancy way of saying that randomness plays a key role. A drunkard walks randomly in one dimension, as defined by the following rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "* At each time step, the drunkard randomly picks a direction (forward or backward) and takes one step in that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, will use Python's `random` library to code the drunkard's walk in an array. In the long homework we will relate this problem to diffusion in a physical system. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Random (drunk) walks are the simplest example of a **Markov chain**. In this problem, however, we will not be using it as a Markov chain---we're assigning some physical meaning to the initial condition and examining the walk as an actual time evolution. You should compare it to the *marble game* in class: when we used a marble to sample the large space of the field (and to count which samples were inside the circle). In the marble game, the order of the samples didn't matter---they were all just pieces of a statistical average. "
